# restaurant-data-analysis-project

## 🍽️ Restaurant Orders SQL Project
This project is a hands-on SQL analysis of a fictional restaurant's order data. The goal was to move beyond solving standalone SQL queries and explore real-world datasets — asking the right questions, writing efficient queries, and uncovering insights from raw data.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset contains two main tables:

menu_items: A list of international dishes with their prices and categories

order_details: A log of customer orders, including item IDs and timestamps

## Total Records: 12,266
Tables: 2
Fields: 8
